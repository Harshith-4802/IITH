## Input format

Enter the values in terminal following the below format -

Order of scanning variables:- m, n, A, b, c, feasible_point

- 1st line contains an integer value of m(the no. of rows)
- 2nd line contains an integer value of n(the no. of columns)
- Next m lines of input is the A matrix,
  - Each row contains n float values seperated with ' '(space)
- We scan b vector in this (m + 3)th line, containing m float values seperated with ' '(space)
- We scan c vector in this (m + 4)th line, containing n float values seperated with ' '(space)
- We scan feasible_point in this (m + 5)th line, containing n float values seperated with ' '(space)
